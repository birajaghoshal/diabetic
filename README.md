# Introduction 

During the summer of 2018 and the following school year, I had the opportunity to work in National Institute of Health (NIH) Lister Hill Center to study convolutional neural network for early detection of diabetic retinopathy eye disease.  The project was conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Jongwoo Kim.

## Diabetic retinopathy

[Diabetic retinopathy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy) is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population of the developed world. It is estimated to affect over 93 million people.

Around 40% to 45% of Americans with diabetes have some stage of the disease. Progression to vision impairment can be slowed or averted if DR is detected in time, however this can be difficult as the disease often shows few symptoms until it is too late to provide effective treatment.

Currently, detecting DR is a time-consuming and manual process that requires a trained clinician to examine and evaluate digital color fundus photographs of the retina. By the time human readers submit their reviews, often a day or two later, the delayed results lead to lost follow up, miscommunication, and delayed treatment.

## Convolutional Neural Network

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a branch of deep learning, have an impressive record for applications in image analysis and interpretation, including medical imaging. Network architectures designed to work with image data were routinely built already in 1970s with useful applications and surpassed other approaches to challenging tasks like handwritten character recognition. However, it wasnâ€™t until several breakthroughs in neural networks such as the implementation of dropout, rectified linear units and the accompanying increase in computing power through graphical processor units (GPUs) that they became viable for more complex image recognition problems. Presently, large CNNs are used to successfully tackle highly complex image recognition tasks with many object classes to an impressive standard. CNNs are used in many current state-of-the-art image classification tasks such as the annual ImageNet and COCO challenges.

## CNN for Diabetic Retinopathy
Two main issues exist within automated grading and particularly CNNs. One is achieving a desirable offset in sensitivity (patients correctly identified as having DR) and specificity (patients correctly identified as not having DR). This is significantly harder for national criteria which is a five class problem in to normal, mild DR, moderate DR, severe DR, and proliferative DR classes. Furthermore, overfitting is a major issue in neural networks. Skewed datasets cause the network to over-fit to the class most prominent in the dataset. Large datasets are often massively skewed. In the dataset, we used less than three percent of images came from the 4th and 5th class, meaning changes had to be made in our network to ensure it could still learn the features of these images.
